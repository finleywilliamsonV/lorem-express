# lorem-express
Lorem Ipsum generator featuring multiple generation varieties

## Objective
I created this app to test & refine the following skills:
  - use Express to create a server, and serve a basic website
  - use PUG as a views engine
  - use MongoDB (with Mongoose) to store and access generation variety texts
  - implement Bootstrap and use to style the page
  - use GitHub as a version control system
  
 ## Getting Started
 This app uses npm, run the following to set it up.
 ```
 npm install
 ```
 The app can be served by running:
 ```
 node app.js
 ```
 At which point the site will be served on port 5000, which can be visited at:
 ```
 localhost:5000
 ```
